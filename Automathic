I've been on my lonesome and you call me and I phone in
To all my plans, say they ain't happenin' and next morning
I blow you up again, you ain't having it, nah
You ain't having it
You ain't having it
Always
You've been running 'round my mind all night, babe
Leave me feeling hypnotized the right way
Loving you is problematic
Girl, you got me automatic
I went out last weekend 'cause my phone says we ain't speaking
And I'm just about to get over it, but this evening
You blew me up again, I ain't having it, nah
I ain't having it
I ain't having it
Always
You've been running 'round my mind all night, babe
Leave me feeling hypnotized the right way
Loving you is problematic
Girl, you got me automatic
Always
You've been running 'round my mind all night, babe
Leave me feeling hypnotized the right way
Loving you is problematic
Girl, you got me automatic
Someday
You'll make me wanna walk away
I promise it won't be today
Baby girl, I'm here to stay
Until it comes around
Someday
(Why you make it hard sometimes?) You'll make me wanna walk away
(Why you make it hard sometimes?) I promise it won't be today
(Why you make it hard? Why you make it?) Baby girl, I'm here to stay
(Okay!)
Always
You've been running 'round my mind all night, babe
Leave me feeling hypnotized the right way
Loving you is problematic
Girl, you got me automatic
